A version of the paper has been submitted to ArXiv [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08908.pdf)

## Running the code

To run the code just execute the following function:

```
runCompactness
```

Inside this function you can select which example from the paper you want to reproduce by assigning to the variable example one of the four options (AORTA_MRI, ESOPHAGUS_CT, RIGHTVENT_MRI, AORTA_CT). Compactness parameters are fixed as used in the paper.
